### What is it
A experimental battle system, inspired in Valkyries Profile, build on Unreal Engine 5 with the only purpose to amuse myself and others who enjoy it

### Who I am
I'm Senior Programming Engineer who works with Enterprise Applications but wants to venture on Game Development using UE5 at the beginning

### What to expect of this
This project development is divided in 3 phases (can be increased over time):

 - Protoype Phase: This phase goals is to create a prototype with all the basics. This have a focus on gameplay funcionality, characters combat, basic engine, etc...
 - Artistic Phase: Here is when the artistic theme is going to be set. Characters, Environments, Musics and Sounds is the goal here.      
 - Engine Phase: This phase is completely focus on the engine of all mechanics. Weapons modifiers, chances to block and avoid a strike, advantages, and others is set on this phase.

For working progress, I can create some videos eventually...
